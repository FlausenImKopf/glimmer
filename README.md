# Glimmer App

> This project was created in hackathon mode and under time constraints in a team of two. [Regina Müller](https://github.com/ReginaMueller) worked on both timeline features. I've worked on the homeview and on the features that let the user add new glimmers. I'm currently (since 11/06/2024) working to refactor everything to bring it up to my coding standards.

A glimmer describes the opposite of a trigger: A glimmer is a moment in your life that evokes happiness, joy, calm, gratitude or a sense of connectedness.


## Description

Our App is designed to help you fight negativity bias (our brains seem hard-wired to focus on the negative) and put a focus on glimmers in your life by tracking moments of gratitude and anticipation.

- Looking forward to brunch with your friends? Make a note of it in the app.
- Grateful to your flatemate for cooking you dinner? Make a note of it in the app.
- Want a visual reminder of all the good in your days? You collect your glimmer moments as stars in a jar.
- Want a reminder of all the things you felt grateful for in the past? Scroll through your gratitude-timeline.
- Want to see all the things you're looking forward to? Your future seems bright in the anticipations-timeline in the app.
